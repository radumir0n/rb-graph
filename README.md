This is a small application that checks if a graph is red-blue colorable:

- if the graph is connected
- if two connected nodes never have the same color

To run the application follow the next steps:

1) Clone the repository 
2) Run `npm i` in the terminal to install the dependencies
3) Run `npm run dev` to run the solution locally
